# SHiFT Code Mirror Bot

A Discord bot that looks for updates to Orcicorn's [SHiFT Code Archive](https://shift.orcicorn.com/) API, then posts and publishes announcements for them in (news) channels of your choice. Also pings any news roles you have set.

Currently in use in the official [Borderlands](discord.gg/borderlands) and [Wonderlands](discord.gg/wonderlands) servers..

Thanks to Orangespire for the idea and continued support.

## Usage

Designed for Python 3.10. Your API key must be placed in the environment variable SHIFT_BOT_API_KEY. Configure the servers you wish to send codes to according to the example in guild_configs.json.
